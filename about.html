        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Avram Stern! This is my first draft to prepare a web development portfolio where I will be sharing all of my favorite work. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the university and I was introduced to code in Java and C#, which I find amazing. But in my spare time I have been taking several courses online about web development. When I'm not fooling around trying to learn how to code, I might be working as an Online Marketing Analyst. I also enjoy exercising, playing video games, watching sports, spending time with my beautiful girlfriend and much more!</p>
